			Hi, UX2.0 is a project funded by 
			<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/inf11.aspx">JISC</a> 
			(Information Environment Programme 2009-11) 
			to undertake research and development to enhance user experience of 
			digital libraries, through technological developments that are centered on 
			usability inspection and evaluation. UX2.0 objectives:
		</p>
		<!--ul>
			<li>To undertake usability inspection and contemporary UX techniques research</li>
			<li>To enhance <a href="http://library.nesc.ed.ac.uk">library@nesc</a> with state‐of‐the‐art technologies</li>
			<li>To evaluate user experience in specific contexts involving real user communities</li>

			<h2>Outline: Web 2.0 Revisit, Usability Perspectives</h2>

			<sup>T</sup>he contemporary experience of users on the Web has undergone 
				marked transformations owing to trends such as Web 2.0, Cloud Computing 
				and the associated user-centered propensities. These transformations have had 
				widespread and significant impacts on user experience (UX) and the 
				expectation of how digital libraries should be facilitated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				UX2.0 deals with the requirement of existing digital libraries to fully engage 
				the end users, who have become less tolerant of badly design system and expect 
				Web 2.0 experience as norms. It aims to enhance the user experience through a 
				technological development framework centered on usability inspection, evaluation 
				and the <a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/001556.html">diffusion-concentration Web 2.0</a> 
				paradigm, dealing with the integration of mashed-up services, widgets in heterogeneous 
				environments as well as digital library as a hub.
			</p>
			<h3>Usability and Evaluation</h3>
			<p>

				There is a pressing need for usability studies to assess the current and 
				future breeds of information environments such that their complex and unique 
				nature can be better understood, well-formed and validated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In UX2.0, 
				usability studies will be performed on a selected digital libraries (DLs) 
				and Web 2.0 technologies. A detailed study will be carried out on library@nesc. 
				The digital library and its subsequent enhancements are subjected to formative 
				evaluation based on the 
				<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/185523/Evaluation-of-Digital-Libraries-Fulltext">Interaction Triptych Framework (ITF)</a>
				which recognises 
				channels of communication between the main components of DLs: user, content and system, 
				and aspects, viz., usability (user-system), usefulness (user-content) and 
				performance (system-content). The evaluation will provide scientific analysis into the 
				current area of UX development and advance the ITF as a framework for Web 2.0. 
				The (perceived) efficacy and usability of Cloud Computing will also be evaluated.
			</p>		
			<h3>UX Enhancement</h3>
			<p>
				A key aspect of UX2.0 is the assimilation of contemporary UX techniques 
				and Cloud Computing, to enhance the user interface and infrastructure of 
				library@nesc. The development is based on the diffusion-concentration 
				paradigm and spans 5 levels of technology stacks: widget, 
				machine services, hub, repository and storage.
			</p>
			<p> Diffusion UX development 
				refers to decontextualised services (widgets, machine services) from 
				library@nesc and their use in other heterogeneous virtual environments 
				designated by the users based on their needs. UX2.0 also considers the 
				diffusion of technologies at infrastructure level: front-end, 
				repository (<a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/">Fedora</a>) and 
				storage through Cloud Computing mechanisms. 
				Concentration UX development targets scenarios that will enhance the 
				role of library@nesc as a hub, through local and federated UX technologies. 
				This involves the adoption of highly dynamic and customisable user-interface 
				(AJAX) and DL-oriented enhancements such as customisable search targets, 
				faceted searching, metadata and content wikis and federated social 
				networking facilities.
